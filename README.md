**Instead of using this mod, I suggest you use Minetest's builtin functionality
that does basically the same thing.**

This is a simple client-side mod for Minetest. It lets you highlight individual
mapblocks using chat commands. An example use case is ensuring a Mesecons device
is inside a single mapblock.

To toggle highlighting of the mapblock you are in, issue the command
`.mapblock_highlight`. Alternatively, you can provide a position as an argument
to the command to toggle the mapblock containing that position instead.

You can issue the command `.mapblock_highlight_clear` to remove all your
mapblock highlights.

Minetest version 5.5.0 or greater is required to use this mod.
